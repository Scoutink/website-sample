Here’s a summary of what this company does:
Who they are
·	The company is based in Chongqing, China (Beibei District, No. 6 Fenghe Road) under the name Chongqing Peg-Bio Biopharm Co., Ltd.. CPHI Online+1
·	On their Chinese website they call themselves “重庆派金生物科技有限公司” (Chongqing Paijin Biotechnology Co., Ltd.), described as a "national high-tech enterprise" specialised in biotech / gene engineering drug R&D. pegbiocq.com+2Patsnap Synapse+2
·	They were founded around 2013. Patsnap Synapse+1
What they do
·	Their core business: they focus on gene engineering and recombinant protein / peptide drugs development and manufacture. Patsnap Synapse+2m.chemicalbook.com+2
·	They have production capabilities described as: construction & screening of genetic engineering strains, process development for recombinant proteins, scale-up production, process validation, manufacturing of clinical trial materials (phase I-III) under GMP conditions. m.chemicalbook.com+1
·	Example of product focus: they list “Semaglutide Intermediate (Recombinant)” among their offerings. CPHI Online
·	Therapeutic areas align with endocrine/metabolic diseases (diabetes, obesity, metabolic dysfunction) and possibly immune system / enzyme therapies. Patsnap Synapse+1
Key strengths / positioning
·	They call themselves a “high-new technology enterprise” which suggests a strong R&D orientation. pegbiocq.com
·	The combination of in-house strain engineering, process development, scale-up and GMP manufacturing suggests they aim to be a “full stack” biotech manufacturer from early-stage development through to clinical materials.
·	Being based in China, they may have cost / scale advantages for production of biologics and peptides.
Some caveats / things to check
·	The website page you tried to access returned an “Internal Error (502)”. So direct information from their site may be spotty.
·	While they have considerable capability, I did not immediately find global regulatory approvals (e.g., US/EU-markets) for finished drugs—so some of their products may be early or mid-stage.
·	The company has multiple names (Peg-Bio, Paijin) depending on translation / region – so when reviewing publicly available data, make sure you’re referencing the correct entity.
In short: The company is a Chinese biotech that specialises in recombinant protein and peptide drug development and manufacturing, especially for metabolic / endocrine disorders and using gene-engineering platforms. If you like, I can pull up a deeper profile (e.g., pipeline, partnerships, financials) for them.
